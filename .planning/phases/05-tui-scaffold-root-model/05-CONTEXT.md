# Phase 5: TUI Scaffold + Root Model - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-03-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

This phase delivers the foundational TUI infrastructure: the `rootModel` (the only `tea.Model` passed to `tea.NewProgram`), the session state machine, the child model interface and stubs, the persistent frame layout (header + message bar + work area + command bar + footer), the modal stack, and the message-passing architecture. No real screen content is implemented — each zone renders a placeholder. All subsequent TUI phases fill zones with real content.

This phase implements:
- All charm.land v2 dependencies added to `go.mod`
- `workArea` enum: `workAreaPreVault`, `workAreaVault`, `workAreaTemplates`, `workAreaSettings`
- `childModel` custom interface (NOT `tea.Model`)
- `rootModel` struct: concrete child pointer fields, modal stack, vault path, terminal size, `*vault.Manager`
- Frame compositor in `rootModel.View()`: constant layout zones, placeholder content
- `modalModel` with push/pop stack mechanics
- Message dispatch rules: domain messages → all live models; keyboard/mouse → focused model only
- Model lifecycle: concrete pointer fields, nil = inactive, no cross-references
- ASCII art logo (`RenderLogo()`) ported from reference project
- Global tick: starts only after vault is opened
- Global `ctrl+Q` quit shortcut wired in `rootModel.Update`
- `main.go` wiring: parse optional vault path arg, instantiate Manager, run program

This phase does NOT implement:
- Any real screen UI (welcome form, password fields, vault tree, secret detail, template editor)
- Real timer logic beyond the tick infrastructure
- Vault open/create/lock operations (Phase 6+)
- Scroll behavior (defined per-component in later phases)

## Implementation Decisions

### Dependencies

**D-01: All charm.land v2 packages added in Phase 5**
- `charm.land/bubbletea/v2` — only `rootModel` implements `tea.Model`
- `charm.land/bubbles/v2` — input components for later phases, added now
- `charm.land/lipgloss/v2` — used immediately for ASCII art and frame layout
- `github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest/v2` — golden file tests
- Pin exact latest versions: `go get charm.land/bubbletea/v2@latest` etc.
- **CRITICAL:** No v1 packages. `View()` returns `tea.View` (not `string`), key events are `tea.KeyPressMsg` (not `tea.KeyMsg`), space key is `"space"` (not `" "`).

### Work Area State Machine

**D-02: `workArea` enum — describes what is mounted in the work area**
```go
type workArea int
const (
    workAreaPreVault  workArea = iota // welcome screen (ASCII art background)
    workAreaVault                     // vault open — tree + detail side by side
    workAreaTemplates                 // template editor — list + detail side by side
    workAreaSettings                  // settings screen
)
```
- `rootModel` tracks `area workArea` — describes what is currently mounted in the work area.
- `workAreaPreVault` renders only the ASCII art welcome background. It has no sub-states and manages no open/create flow.
- **Open vault, create vault, save vault, change password** — these are **modal orchestration flows**: sequences of modals pushed onto the modal stack (e.g., file picker modal → password modal). The work area stays unchanged while modals are active. The work area only transitions *after* a flow completes successfully.
- Lock operation = wipe sensitive memory + set `area = workAreaPreVault` (shows welcome/ASCII art). To re-open the vault, the user starts the open-vault modal flow from the welcome screen. No `stateLocked`.
- `rootModel` stores `vaultPath string` — populated via domain message when a modal flow completes, persists across lock cycles.

### Child Model Interface

**D-03: Custom `childModel` interface — does NOT implement `tea.Model`**
```go
type childModel interface {
    Update(tea.Msg) tea.Cmd    // mutates in place, returns only Cmd (no self-replacement)
    View() string               // returns string, NOT tea.View
    SetSize(w, h int)           // receives allocated size from rootModel compositor
    Context() FlowContext       // exposes navigation/selection state for flow dispatch (see D-20)
}
```
- `View()` returns `string`. Only `rootModel.View()` returns `tea.View` (satisfying `tea.Model`).
- `Update` uses pointer receivers and mutates in place — no self-replacement return.
- `Context()` returns a `FlowContext` value (defined in D-20). The child fills navigation/selection fields; `rootModel` enriches with vault-level fields before querying `FlowRegistry`.
- Whether child interface includes `Init() tea.Cmd` is **left to researcher/planner** — needs investigation of Bubble Tea v2 initialization patterns.
- `SetSize(w, h int)` receives the child's **allocated** size (not terminal size). `rootModel` computes each child's share on `tea.WindowSizeMsg` and calls `SetSize` on all live children.
- **Children and modals are position-unaware:** they render their content filling exactly the size given by `SetSize()`. They have no knowledge of where they will be placed on the terminal. Positioning and overlay are exclusively `rootModel`'s responsibility.

### Model Lifecycle

**D-04: Concrete pointer fields — nil = inactive/dead**
```go
type rootModel struct {
    area          workArea
    mgr           *vault.Manager
    vaultPath     string
    width, height int

    // Child models — nil means inactive (dead, no memory held)
    preVault       *preVaultModel      // active during workAreaPreVault
    vaultTree      *vaultTreeModel     // active during workAreaVault
    secretDetail   *secretDetailModel  // active during workAreaVault
    templateList   *templateListModel  // active during workAreaTemplates
    templateDetail *templateDetailModel // active during workAreaTemplates
    settings       *settingsModel      // active during workAreaSettings

    // Modal stack — LIFO, last element = topmost/active
    modals         []*modalModel

    // Active flow — nil = no flow in progress (see D-19, D-20)
    activeFlow     flowHandler
    flows          *FlowRegistry

    // Shared services — passed to every child at construction
    actions        *ActionManager
    messages       *MessageManager
}
```
- When transitioning to a new state: allocate new child via constructor, set old child field to `nil`. Go GC reclaims the old model.
- Modals: allocated on `pushModal(...)`, popped on dismiss via `popModal()`.
- **nil-pointer safety:** store children as concrete pointer types, never as `childModel` interface. A typed nil stored in an interface is NOT nil in Go — this is a compile trap. Interface is used only transiently (e.g., in `liveModels()` helper).

**D-05: `liveModels()` helper for broadcast**
```go
func (m *rootModel) liveModels() []childModel {
    var live []childModel
    if m.preVault != nil        { live = append(live, m.preVault) }
    if m.vaultTree != nil       { live = append(live, m.vaultTree) }
    if m.secretDetail != nil    { live = append(live, m.secretDetail) }
    if m.templateList != nil    { live = append(live, m.templateList) }
    if m.templateDetail != nil  { live = append(live, m.templateDetail) }
    if m.settings != nil        { live = append(live, m.settings) }
    for _, modal := range m.modals { live = append(live, modal) }
    return live
}
```

### Message Dispatch Rules

**D-06: Domain messages broadcast, input messages focused**
- **Domain messages** (vault changed, timer tick, etc.) → `rootModel` dispatches to ALL live models via `liveModels()` + all modals in stack.
- **Keyboard/mouse events** (`tea.KeyPressMsg`, `tea.MouseMsg`) → dispatch priority order:
  1. Global shortcuts in `rootModel` (`ctrl+Q`, `?`) — always intercepted first.
  2. If `activeFlow != nil` → delegate to `activeFlow.Update(msg)` — flow manages its own modals and async Cmds.
  3. Else if modal stack non-empty → topmost modal (`modals[len(modals)-1]`) has focus.
  4. Else → call `ctx := m.activeChild.Context()`, enrich with vault-level state (`ctx.VaultOpen = m.mgr.IsOpen()`, `ctx.VaultDirty = m.mgr.HasUnsavedChanges()`), then check `flows.ForKey(key, ctx)` — if a descriptor is found → allocate flow via `New(ctx)`, set `activeFlow` (see D-20).
  5. Else → currently active base child model.
- No child model ever calls another child model's methods or reads another child model's fields. All state changes flow through `vault.Manager` → domain message → `rootModel` broadcast.

### Inter-Model Communication Pattern

**D-07: Events via Msg; data access depends on case**
- **Event/mutation notifications**: always via `tea.Cmd` returning a domain message. No child calls another child's methods. No shared mutable state between siblings.
- **Data retrieval**: depends on the child's needs — not restricted to `vault.Manager` alone:
  - Domain data (vault tree, secrets) → `vault.Manager` (the primary source).
  - App-level state (e.g., current vault path, active area) → may access `rootModel` fields directly if `rootModel` exposes them via a read-only interface. **Whether a shared read accessor on `rootModel` is introduced is left to researcher/planner** — evaluate cost vs. passing individual values via constructor or message.
  - Specialized concerns (e.g., clipboard, OS integration) → may warrant a dedicated helper/manager; decided per-phase.
- `rootModel` passes `*vault.Manager` to each child at construction time. Additional dependencies passed via constructor or injected on transition.

**Domain message taxonomy — granularity rationale:** Bubble Tea re-renders the full screen after every `Update()` regardless, so granular messages don’t reduce rendering work. Their value is letting children make precise local decisions (e.g., `secretDetailModel` ignores `secretReorderedMsg` without touching Manager). Avoid per-operation messages for every vault mutation — use the set below:

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `secretAddedMsg{id}` | Secret created or duplicated |
| `secretDeletedMsg{id}` | Secret marked for deletion |
| `secretRestoredMsg{id}` | Deletion mark removed |
| `secretModifiedMsg{id}` | Secret values or structure changed |
| `secretMovedMsg{id, fromFolder, toFolder}` | Secret moved between folders |
| `secretReorderedMsg{}` | Secret reordered within a folder |
| `folderStructureChangedMsg{}` | Any folder create/rename/move/reorder/delete |
| `vaultSavedMsg{}` | Vault written to disk (deleted secrets removed from memory) |
| `vaultReloadedMsg{}` | Full reload from disk (Fluxo 10 — all children reset state) |
| `vaultClosedMsg{}` | Vault locked or closed (all children wipe sensitive memory) |
| `vaultChangedMsg{}` | Generic fallback — used by flows when the specific mutation type is not relevant to broadcast |

Children that don’t care about a specific message type simply ignore it.

**Two tiers of user-initiated operations:**
- **Simple operations** (no modal, no async) — handled entirely by the child's `Update()` via a **Cmd factory**. The factory calls `vault.Manager` and returns the appropriate domain message. Children never call Manager + fabricate a Cmd separately — always use the factory. Factories live in `mutations.go` alongside the message type definitions. Examples: favorite, mark for deletion, reorder, rename folder.
- **Orchestrated flows** (requires modals and/or async work) — handled by a `flowHandler` registered in `FlowRegistry`. Examples: open vault, create vault, save-as, change password, lock, quit with confirmation. The criterion: **does the operation need a modal or an async goroutine?** If yes → `flowHandler`. If no → Cmd factory.

### Frame Layout

**D-08: Constant frame with pluggable work area**
`rootModel.View()` always renders:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header                          │  ← nome do app, nome do cofre, indicador de alterações
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Message bar                     │  ← reads MessageManager.Current() (see D-17)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│ Work area                       │  ← changes by state (see D-09)
│                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Command bar                     │  ← reads ActionManager.Visible() (see D-16)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Frame zones are composed with lipgloss; header and bars have fixed heights, work area gets remaining height.
- Frame structure **may grow** in later phases — not fully locked. Planner should not over-engineer zone count.
- **`rootModel.View()` delegates frame composition to a dedicated method** (e.g., `renderFrame() string`) rather than inlining all rendering logic. This keeps `View()` as a thin dispatcher.
- **Modal overlay:** after composing the base frame, `rootModel.View()` checks the modal stack. If non-empty, the topmost modal's `View()` output is overlaid on top of the full frame using `lipgloss.Place()`. Modal renders its own content only — it has no knowledge of its screen position.
- **Compositor principle:** only `rootModel` knows the terminal dimensions and the position of each zone. Children and modals receive their allocated size via `SetSize()` and render content that fills that size. No child or modal uses absolute terminal coordinates.

**D-09: Work area content by `workArea` value**
| `workArea` | Work area content |
|------------|------------------|
| `workAreaPreVault` | `preVaultModel` — renders ASCII art welcome background and initial action hints only |
| `workAreaVault` | `vaultTreeModel` (left) + `secretDetailModel` (right) side by side |
| `workAreaTemplates` | `templateListModel` (left) + `templateDetailModel` (right) side by side |
| `workAreaSettings` | `settingsModel` fills full work area |

- `preVaultModel` is a simple background model. It does NOT manage open/create sub-states.
- Open vault / create vault / save vault / change password are **modal orchestration flows** — sequences of modals pushed onto the modal stack. The work area remains visible behind the modal stack during these flows.
- When a modal flow succeeds, it emits a domain message that causes `rootModel` to transition the work area (e.g., `vaultOpenedMsg{}` → `area = workAreaVault`).
- All list/tree/detail child models **must support vertical scroll** — exact mechanism left to researcher.

**D-10: Modal stack as overlay layer**
- Modals float above the frame as a layer rendered on top via `lipgloss.Place()`.
- Stack: `modals []*modalModel` — LIFO.
- Push: `modals = append(modals, newModal(...))`.
- Pop: `modals = modals[:len(modals)-1]` on dismiss (ESC or selection).
- Topmost modal receives keyboard input; all modals receive domain messages.
- Background models remain live during modal display; they do not receive keyboard/mouse input.
- On pop to empty stack, keyboard/mouse returns to active base child.
- Known modal types (stubs in Phase 5): file picker, password entry, password creation, help, confirmation.

### Timers

**D-11: `rootModel` owns all timeout decisions; timeout logic delegated to Manager**
- `rootModel` tracks `lastActionAt time.Time` — updated on every meaningful user input.
- On each `tickMsg`, `rootModel` asks `vault.Manager` whether each timeout has fired (e.g., `mgr.IsLockExpired(lastActionAt)`, `mgr.IsClipboardExpired(lastActionAt)`). Timer configuration (durations, enabled/disabled) stays encapsulated in the Manager/domain layer — `rootModel` never reads raw config values.
- When a timeout fires, `rootModel` dispatches a **specific typed message** to all live models (e.g., `lockTimeoutMsg{}`, `clipboardTimeoutMsg{}`). Children never inspect the ticker or query the Manager to decide a timeout themselves.
- Children receive `tickMsg` only for **periodic UI updates** — e.g., refreshing a clock displayed in the header. They must not use tick to implement timeout logic.
- Before vault opens there is no active vault, so timeout methods must handle that case gracefully (return `false`). No tick fires before `workAreaVault` is entered.
- The global 1-second tick (`tickMsg`) is started as a `tea.Cmd` when transitioning into `workAreaVault`. It does NOT start in `rootModel.Init()`.

### Quit Shortcut

**D-12: Global keyboard shortcuts wired in `rootModel`**
- `ctrl+Q` — global quit. Intercepted before routing to any child or modal. Behavior follows `fluxos.md`: confirmation modal if unsaved changes, direct quit if no changes. `ctrl+C` is NOT quit. `q` is NOT a global quit.
- `?` — global help. Pushes `helpModal` onto the modal stack regardless of current work area or modal depth. `helpModal` reads `ActionManager.All()` to show the full action list. Dismissed via ESC.
- `rootModel` registers its own global shortcuts into `ActionManager` at startup.

### Vault Path Ownership

**D-13: `rootModel` owns vault path**
- `rootModel.vaultPath string` is the single source of truth.
- The file picker modal communicates the chosen path to `rootModel` via a `Cmd` returning a domain message (e.g., `vaultPathSelectedMsg{path: "..."}`) — never via direct field access.
- `main.go` may also provide an initial path via constructor arg (`newRootModel(mgr, initialPath)`).

### ASCII Art Logo

**D-14: `RenderLogo()` ported from reference project**
- `ascii.go` in `internal/tui/` contains `AsciiArt` constant and `RenderLogo()` function.
- 5-line wordmark, gradient coloring: one lipgloss color per line.
- Palette: `["#9d7cd8", "#89ddff", "#7aa2f7", "#7dcfff", "#bb9af7"]` (violet → blue/cyan).
- Reference implementation: `c:\git\Abditum2\internal\tui\ascii.go`.

### File Layout

**D-15: Separate files per concern in `internal/tui/`**
- `root.go` — `rootModel`, `workArea` enum, `Init`/`Update`/`View`, `liveModels()`, dispatch logic
- `modal.go` — `modalModel`, push/pop helpers
- `state.go` — timer helpers, tick handler, domain message types
- `mutations.go` — Cmd factories for simple operations (see D-07); one factory per vault mutation
- `ascii.go` — `AsciiArt` constant, `RenderLogo()`
- `actions.go` — `ActionManager` (see D-16)
- `messages.go` — `MessageManager` (see D-17)
- `dialogs.go` — dialog factory functions (see D-18)
- `flow_open_vault.go` — `openVaultFlow` + `openVaultDescriptor` stubs (see D-19, D-20)
- `flow_create_vault.go` — `createVaultFlow` + `createVaultDescriptor` stubs (see D-19, D-20)
- `flows.go` — `FlowRegistry`, `flowDescriptor` interface, `FlowContext` struct (see D-20)
- `prevault.go` — `preVaultModel` stub (ASCII art welcome background; no sub-states)
- `vaulttree.go` — `vaultTreeModel` stub
- `secretdetail.go` — `secretDetailModel` stub
- `templatelist.go` — `templateListModel` stub
- `templatedetail.go` — `templateDetailModel` stub
- `settings.go` — `settingsModel` stub
- `help.go` — `helpModal` stub (reads `ActionManager.All()` to list all registered actions)

### Action Manager

**D-16: `ActionManager` — centralized action registry shared by all children**
- **Guiding analogy:** just as `vault.Manager` is the API for vault operations, `ActionManager` is the API for defining which actions are available at any given moment.
- `ActionManager` is a **shared mutable object** (concrete pointer) instantiated in `main.go` and passed to `rootModel`, which in turn passes it to every child at construction time.
- Responsibility: maintain the pool of currently registered actions (keybinding + label + description); decide which subset to surface in the command bar and in what order/grouping.
- **Registration**: each child calls methods on `ActionManager` to register the actions it owns when it becomes active (or when its context changes). On deactivation/nil, the child's actions are cleared from the registry.
- **Command bar** reads `ActionManager.Visible()` — a prioritized, display-width-aware subset of registered actions.
- **Help modal** reads `ActionManager.All()` — the full list of all registered actions, grouped.
- **`rootModel`** registers global shortcuts (e.g., `ctrl+Q`, `?`) into `ActionManager` at startup; these are always present.
- `ActionManager` does NOT know about Bubble Tea internals — it is a plain Go struct with no `tea.Cmd` or messaging. It is queried synchronously from `View()` only.
- **Grouping, priority logic, and registration API shape** are left to researcher/planner — do not over-specify in Phase 5 stub.

### Agent's Discretion
- Whether `childModel` interface includes `Init() tea.Cmd` — needs Bubble Tea v2 research
- Exact lipgloss styles for frame zones (colors, borders, padding) — Phase 5 uses minimal/placeholder styles
- Exact height allocation for header, message bar, command bar rows
- Constructor signatures for each child stub
- Exact domain message type names and fields
- `main.go` error handling details (generic fatal message format)
- `ActionManager` registration API shape (method names, `Action` struct fields, context scoping mechanism)
- `ActionManager` grouping and priority logic for `Visible()` — Phase 5 stub may return a flat list
- `MessageManager` API shape (e.g., whether it supports message severity/type, auto-clear after timeout, etc.)
- `dialogs` factory: exact function signatures, whether callbacks use `tea.Cmd` or typed messages, additional pre-defined dialog types beyond message/confirm
- `flowHandler` interface exact shape; whether flows receive domain messages or only input messages; how a flow signals completion to `rootModel`
- `FlowRegistry` ownership API shape (how children tag their registrations for bulk unregistration on deactivation)

### Message Manager

**D-17: `MessageManager` — centralized API for setting the message bar content**
- **Guiding analogy:** just as `ActionManager` is the API for defining available actions, `MessageManager` is the API for setting what message/hint is shown in the message bar at any moment.
- `MessageManager` is a **shared mutable object** (concrete pointer), instantiated in `main.go`, passed to `rootModel` and to every child at construction time.
- **Writing:** any child calls `messages.Set(text)` (or a typed variant) during its own `Update()` — no `tea.Cmd` or message needed. The call is synchronous and mutates the manager's internal state.
- **Reading:** `rootModel.View()` calls `messages.Current()` when composing the message bar zone. Since Bubble Tea re-renders after every `Update()`, the view is always fresh — no notification or broadcast mechanism is needed.
- Children must NOT read from `MessageManager` — it is write-only from their perspective.
- `rootModel` may also write to `MessageManager` directly for global-level hints (e.g., "vault locked").
- **API shape** (e.g., severity levels, auto-clear after N seconds, message queue vs. single slot) is left to researcher/planner.

### Flow Handlers

**D-19: `flowHandler` interface — encapsulates multi-step modal orchestration**
- **Problem solved:** multi-step flows (open vault, create vault, save-as, change password, lock, quit-with-confirmation) would make `rootModel.Update()` enormous if inlined. Each flow is instead a dedicated object.
- **Interface:**
```go
type flowHandler interface {
    Update(tea.Msg) tea.Cmd  // mutates flow state, returns Cmds (push modals, async work, domain msgs)
}
```
  - No `View()` — flows have no visual representation of their own; they push modals onto `rootModel`'s stack to show UI.
  - No `SetSize()` — not needed.
- **`rootModel` field:** `activeFlow flowHandler` — `nil` when no flow is running.
- **Starting a flow:** via `FlowRegistry` (see D-20) — `rootModel` no longer allocates flows directly or handles `startXxxFlowMsg{}`.
- **Dispatch during active flow:** `rootModel` delegates input events to `activeFlow.Update()` (priority 2 in D-06). The flow pushes/pops modals and returns async Cmds directly.
- **Completing a flow:** the flow emits a completion message (e.g., `vaultOpenedMsg{}`, `flowCancelledMsg{}`); `rootModel` handles the transition and sets `activeFlow = nil`.
- **Flow files in Phase 5:** stubs only — no real logic. Concrete flows implemented in Phase 6+.
- **Known flows:** `openVaultFlow`, `createVaultFlow`. Additional flows (save-as, change password, lock, quit confirmation) identified in later phases.
- **Whether flows receive domain messages** (tick, vault changed, etc.) is left to researcher/planner.

### Flow Registry

**D-20: `FlowRegistry` + `flowDescriptor` + `FlowContext` — repository of all available flows**
- **Problem solved:** `rootModel` should not contain a dispatch table of key → flow. Each flow self-describes its trigger and availability. `FlowContext` captures the complete context needed to evaluate applicability — no closures, no per-child registration.
- **`FlowContext` struct:**
```go
// FlowContext captures the complete navigation/vault state at the moment of dispatch.
// The active child fills navigation fields via Context(); rootModel adds vault-level fields.
type FlowContext struct {
    // Filled by rootModel from vault.Manager
    VaultOpen  bool
    VaultDirty bool
    // Filled by the active child's Context() method
    FocusedFolder   *vault.Pasta
    FocusedSecret   *vault.Segredo
    SecretOpen      bool
    FocusedField    *vault.Campo
    FocusedTemplate *vault.ModeloSegredo
    Mode            int  // child-defined: e.g., view vs edit, left vs right pane focus
}
```
- **`flowDescriptor` interface:**
```go
type flowDescriptor interface {
    Key()                     string       // keyboard shortcut that triggers this flow
    Label()                   string       // display label for ActionManager / help
    IsApplicable(FlowContext) bool         // pure function — can this flow start given current context?
    New(FlowContext)           flowHandler  // factory — creates a fresh handler from current context
}
```
- **`FlowRegistry`** is a shared mutable object (concrete pointer) — instantiated in `main.go`, stored on `rootModel`. **Not passed to children** — children no longer register flows.
- **All flows registered globally by `rootModel` at startup** — both global flows (open vault, save, lock, quit…) and child-scoped flows (edit secret, delete folder…). `IsApplicable(ctx)` handles availability: a flow for "edit secret" simply returns `false` when `ctx.FocusedSecret == nil` or `ctx.VaultOpen == false`.
- **`FlowRegistry` is exclusively for orchestrated flows** — operations that require modals and/or async goroutines. Simple atomic operations (no modal, no async) are handled directly by the child via Cmd factories in `mutations.go` (see D-07). If an operation needs a modal or async work → `flowHandler`. Otherwise → Cmd factory.
- **`IsApplicable(ctx FlowContext)` is a pure function** — evaluated against the complete `FlowContext` assembled by `rootModel` just before dispatch. No closures, no child-held state. Highly testable: call `IsApplicable(FlowContext{VaultOpen: true, FocusedSecret: &s})` without spinning up any model.
- **Dispatch** (step 4 in D-06): `flows.ForKey(key, ctx)` returns the first applicable descriptor; `rootModel` calls `New(ctx)` and sets `activeFlow`. The `ctx` passed to `New()` carries all the state the flow needs to start (e.g., the focused secret entity pointer).
- **Integration with `ActionManager`:** `rootModel` (or `ActionManager`) calls `flows.Applicable(ctx)` to populate the command bar with flow actions alongside child-registered non-flow actions.
- **Registration API shape** (bulk unregister, grouping) is left to researcher/planner.

### Dialog Factory

**D-18: `dialogs` package — factory functions for pre-defined modal dialogs**
- **Different from D-16/D-17:** dialogs are not shared mutable state — they are event-driven. Creating a dialog means returning a `tea.Cmd` that emits a `pushModalMsg{}`, which `rootModel` intercepts and pushes onto the modal stack.
- **Pre-defined dialog types (stubs in Phase 5):**
  - `dialogs.Message(title, text string) tea.Cmd` — informational, dismissed via ESC or Enter
  - `dialogs.Confirm(question string, onYes, onNo tea.Cmd) tea.Cmd` — yes/no prompt; fires the appropriate Cmd on selection
  - Additional types (e.g., multi-option selection) are left to researcher/planner
- **Usage by children:** a child's `Update()` returns `dialogs.Confirm(...)` as its Cmd. No direct access to `rootModel`'s modal stack.
- `dialogs` functions are stateless — they produce a `tea.Cmd` and nothing else. No shared object to pass at construction time.
- `rootModel.Update()` handles `pushModalMsg{}` and appends to `modals` stack (consistent with D-10).
- **Exact function signatures and callback mechanism** are left to researcher/planner.

- `arquitetura.md` §1 — Technology choices: `charm.land/bubbletea/v2`, `charm.land/bubbles/v2`, `charm.land/lipgloss/v2`, `teatest/v2`; `View()` returns `tea.View`, key events `tea.KeyPressMsg`
- `arquitetura.md` §2 — Package structure (`internal/tui/`)
- `arquitetura.md` §3 — Manager pattern: TUI interacts with domain exclusively through Manager
- `arquitetura.md` §5 — Build conventions: CGO_ENABLED=0, no net imports, crypto/rand only
- `arquitetura.md` §6 — Security: mlock, memory wipe on lock/exit, clipboard clear, screen clear (`\033[3J\033[2J\033[H`)

### Domain Layer
- `arquitetura-dominio.md` §1 — Encapsulation: all entity fields lowercase, TUI reads via exported getters only
- `arquitetura-dominio.md` §8 — `Manager.Vault()` returns live `*Cofre` pointer; safety via package encapsulation

### Behavior Specification
- `fluxos.md` — User task flows including quit confirmation logic (VAULT-14), lock behavior (VAULT-13)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` §VAULT-11 through §VAULT-14 — Lock, quit, clipboard, screen clear requirements

### Reference Implementation
- `c:\git\Abditum2\internal\tui\ascii.go` — `AsciiArt` constant and `RenderLogo()` to port verbatim

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- `internal/vault.Manager` — all vault operations; TUI must exclusively use this
- `internal/vault.Cofre`, `Pasta`, `Segredo` — domain entities with exported getters
- `internal/crypto.EvaluatePasswordStrength` — used in create-vault flow (Phase 6)
- `internal/storage.RecoverOrphans`, `DetectExternalChange` — called on vault open (Phase 6)
- `c:\git\Abditum2\internal\tui\ascii.go` — `RenderLogo()` reference implementation

### Established Patterns
- All sensitive data as `[]byte`, never `string`; zeroed on lock/exit
- Error messages always generic — no Go error strings, no file paths in user-facing output
- `CGO_ENABLED=0` enforced globally

### Integration Points
- `cmd/abditum/main.go` — currently `os.Exit(0)`; Phase 5 replaces with real TUI bootstrap
- `internal/vault.NewManager()` (or equivalent constructor) — instantiated in `main.go`, passed to `rootModel`
- `internal/tui` package — currently only `doc.go`; Phase 5 populates it

## Specific Ideas

- ASCII art logo: exact implementation from `c:\git\Abditum2\internal\tui\ascii.go` — 5-line wordmark with violet→cyan gradient, `RenderLogo()` returns colored string via lipgloss.
- Reference project at `c:\git\Abditum2` may contain additional TUI patterns worth reviewing during research.
- Modal stack (not single pointer) enables modals opening modals — confirmed use case in the app (e.g., file picker opening a confirmation overlay).
- Work area layout for `stateVaultOpen` and template editor is structurally identical (left list/tree + right detail panel) — the compositor logic can be shared.

## Deferred Ideas

- Exact scroll implementation for tree/list/detail — each component decides its scroll mechanics in its respective phase (7, 8, etc.)
- Real visual design of header, message bar, command bar — Phase 6 onwards when content exists
- Settings screen layout — Phase 9
- Template editor UI layout — Phase 8
